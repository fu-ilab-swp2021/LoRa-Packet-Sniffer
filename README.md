# LoRa-Packet-Sniffer
RIOT based LoRa-WAN packet sniffer

This project was part of the course 'software project internet technologies' at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and was inspired by the paper '[LoRadar: LoRa sensor network monitoring through passive packet sniffing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3431832.3431835)' by Kwon Nung Choi et al..

We programmed a passive packet sniffing application for LongeRange (LoRa) signals based on RIOT-OS. As hardware we used a LoRa board by STMicroelectronics (B-L072Z-LRWAN1).
