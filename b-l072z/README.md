## b-l072z ##

This folder contains the C code which is compiled and flashed to the device as well as the required Makefile.
[main.c](https://github.com/fu-ilab-swp2021/LoRa-Packet-Sniffer/blob/b0acb475f40019666972450c426708c1a55a6d01/b-l072z/main.c) initalizes the sniffing process when the button is toggled. After that [radio.c](https://github.com/fu-ilab-swp2021/LoRa-Packet-Sniffer/blob/main/b-l072z/radio.c) manages the sniffing process. It starts to listen on a given channel which is set via the 'datarate' (dr) and hops the LoRa frequencies. If a signal gets detected the program formats the output and writes it on the SD card with the help of [storage.c](https://github.com/fu-ilab-swp2021/LoRa-Packet-Sniffer/blob/main/b-l072z/storage.c). [storage.c](https://github.com/fu-ilab-swp2021/LoRa-Packet-Sniffer/blob/main/b-l072z/storage.c) initalizes the SD card and creates a new 'DATA' file in which the output of [radio.c](https://github.com/fu-ilab-swp2021/LoRa-Packet-Sniffer/blob/main/b-l072z/radio.c) will be saved.
